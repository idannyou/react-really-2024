## Custom Dev Tools

The purpose of using a custom DevTool is to easily replicate configurations that would be difficult or time-consuming to create manually. By automating these setups, you can efficiently recreate and test various scenarios, especially complex or edge cases.

When combined with Cypress or other end-to-end (E2E) testing libraries, this approach enables you to thoroughly test scenarios that might be challenging to cover using traditional testing methods. This ensures a more comprehensive validation of your applicationâ€™s behavior under different conditions.
